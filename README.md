# Token Starter
Connect to your Ethereum network and start deploying tokens as ERC-20 smart contracts.

## Setup your environment
Start by running your Ethereum client (Geth, Parity, etc) and connecting to your network. You will also need a Metamask account on your network (with some ETH in it).
```shell
git clone TODO: REPO_URL
cd token-starter
npm install
```
Change .env.example to .env and fill in your network information. Include your address and password for your Metamask account.

## Serve your app
Node:
```shell
npm run dev
```

## Explore
To sample hardhat, try running some of the following tasks:
```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
